## Assignment 1
This assignment covered the basics of Image Denoising using Markov Random Field(MRF) Priors and obtaining the MAP estimate by maximising the posterior probability objective function using an adaptive gradient descent

## Assignment 2
This assignment dealt with image segmentation, particularly handling segmentation of brain MRI images. Segmentation was done under the presence of an unknown bias field and a measurement noise.

## Assignment 3
This assignment was all about shape analysis. Mean and Variation in the shape of human hands was analysed using 2 methods. We used similarity transforms to obtain Procrustes distance between shapes and obtain a distribution over it
